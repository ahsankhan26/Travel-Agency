# Travel-Agency
This was my first group project of programming so it lacks many features.
The name input is character array so no spaces is allowed.
The domestic cities are "Karachi", "Lahore", "Faisalabad", "Islamabad", "Multan".
The international cities are "London", "Washington DC", "Beiijng", "Tokyo", "Dubai".
The id number is generated randomly and should be memorized in order to search or edit the data.
the print ticket details i.e. "Flight number", "Price" are hardcoded.
